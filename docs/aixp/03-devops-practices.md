# Part 3 — DevOps/SRE Practices Adopted into aiXP

These aren't XP-derived — they come from a separate lineage (DevOps, SRE) — but they fit the same gap the merge/integration bottleneck exposed: once verification can't all happen pre-merge without becoming a bottleneck, some of the safety net has to move to *after* merge, in a controlled way. Naming these explicitly, rather than leaving them implicit in Merge/Integration Authority.

### 11. Trunk-Based Development
Short-lived branches, frequent integration to trunk — not new to software, but worth stating as a required discipline rather than an assumption, given that concurrent agents can generate branch volume a solo/small team never produced by hand. Long-lived branches compound the review backlog exactly where fatigue is already concentrated.

### 12. Feature Flags / Progressive Delivery
Decouples *merge* from *release*. Code can land on trunk and pass through CI without being exposed to real users yet — which lowers the stakes of merging, directly easing the Merge/Integration Authority bottleneck. Especially relevant to Perception-Gated Work: a UI change can merge behind a flag, get toggled on for the developer only, iterated on in place, then released once it's actually right — without every intermediate tweak needing a full manual on-device pass.

### 13. Observability as the Post-Merge Feedback Loop
For a small team without dedicated QA, production telemetry becomes the primary catch mechanism for exactly the category that resists pre-merge automation — Perception-Gated Work and other non-unit-testable behavior. This is the practice that makes it *safe* to lean on Feature Flags rather than exhaustive manual pre-release testing: ship narrow, watch what happens, widen exposure once it's confirmed clean.

### 14. Error Budgets (adapted)
An explicit, stated tolerance for a certain rate of post-merge issues, in exchange for not gatekeeping every change with maximal pre-merge scrutiny. Formalizes a trade-off that's currently being made implicitly and inconsistently (sometimes full manual test, sometimes "I'll just code it myself") — makes the risk-tiering decision explicit and consistent rather than ad hoc, and gives a defensible answer to "why wasn't this tested more before it shipped."

### 15. Blameless Postmortems (adapted)
When something does slip through despite the review layers, a short retrospective on *which layer of the process failed* — spec, agent role topology, executive review, or verification gap — rather than which agent or which output was at fault. Keeps the focus on refining the discipline itself rather than assigning blame to a tool that can't learn from blame anyway.
