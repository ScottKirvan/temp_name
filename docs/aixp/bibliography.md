# Bibliography / References for Further Study

**Extreme Programming (primary sources)**
- Kent Beck, *Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change* (2nd ed., 2004) — the canonical source for the 12 practices
- Kent Beck & Cynthia Andres, *Planning Extreme Programming* (2000)
- Ron Jeffries, Ann Anderson, Chet Hendrickson, *Extreme Programming Installed* (2000)

**Agile / Kanban / Lean**
- *Manifesto for Agile Software Development* — agilemanifesto.org — the four value-pairs, useful as a structural contrast point for whatever manifesto format this project lands on
- Mary Poppendieck & Tom Poppendieck, *Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit* (2003) — source of the "eliminate waste" framing referenced under Simple Design/YAGNI
- David J. Anderson, *Kanban: Successful Evolutionary Change for Your Technology Business* (2010) — WIP limits, pull systems

**Architecture / Design Discipline**
- Neal Ford, Rebecca Parsons, Patrick Kua, *Building Evolutionary Architectures* (2017) — source of "fitness functions," relevant to bounding refactoring/scope creep and possibly Metaphor's replacement
- Eric Evans, *Domain-Driven Design* (2003) — relevant background for Domain Gap Surfacing and ADR-level spec work
- Michael Nygard's ADR format (original blog post: "Documenting Architecture Decisions," 2011) — likely the direct ancestor of the spec-first ADR practice

**DevOps / SRE (relevant to Merge/Integration Authority)**
- Gene Kim, Kevin Behr, George Spafford, *The Phoenix Project* (2013) — narrative introduction to DevOps flow concepts
- Google, *Site Reliability Engineering* (2016, free online: sre.google/books) — error budgets, postmortems, relevant to merge-bottleneck/candidate-build thinking
- Jez Humble & David Farley, *Continuous Delivery* (2010) — the deeper technical background behind CI/CD risk-tiering

**Adjacent "AI-Native SDLC" Literature (for direct comparison — see Part 6)**
- Anthropic Applied AI team, "The AI-Native SDLC playbook," claude.com/blog, August 21, 2026 — the primary comparison point for Part 6; org-scale, artifact-driven (intent.md/spec.md/plan.md), no XP lineage
- AWS (Raja SP), "AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AI-DLC)," 2025 — a competing org-scale framing, worth reading alongside the Anthropic playbook for contrast
- Search for "AI-native SDLC" plus the current year before citing further — this term is being actively contested and redefined by multiple vendors concurrently; treat any single source as one perspective among several, not settled terminology

**AI-Assisted Development (current, fast-moving — verify recency before citing)**
- Anthropic's own engineering blog and docs on Claude Code (claude.com/docs) — primary source for how the tool is intended to be used, worth checking for anything cited about its capabilities
- GitHub's engineering blog on Copilot usage patterns — useful comparative data on AI-pairing at scale in human teams, different context (large orgs, not solo/small-team) but relevant contrast
- Search for recent (2025–2026) papers/preprints on "AI pair programming," "LLM code review," and "agentic software development" via arXiv (cs.SE category) — this space moves fast enough that anything older than a year should be treated as historical rather than current

**Adjacent/Contrasting Methodologies (mentioned but not adopted)**
- Harlan Mills et al. on Cleanroom Software Engineering — IBM technical reports, 1980s; mostly of historical interest but relevant to the "formal spec, AI implements faithfully" thread
- Dan North, "Introducing BDD" (2006, original article) — Given/When/Then framing, relevant to Spec-First Prompting's executable-adjacent variants

**Versioning / Release Discipline**
- Tom Preston-Werner, *Semantic Versioning 2.0.0* — semver.org — the canonical SemVer spec
- *Conventional Commits* — conventionalcommits.org — the commit-message convention referenced in Part 5, worth reading directly before folding into Coding Standards
- CalVer — calver.org — informal reference for calendar-based versioning schemes and when teams choose it over SemVer

*Note: several of the AI-specific sources above will go stale quickly given how fast this space is moving — worth re-searching immediately before citing anything in a final draft, rather than relying on what's listed here.*
