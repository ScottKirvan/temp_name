# Part 4 — Testing Tiers & Strategy: A Primer for aiXP

Most engineers have heard these terms without a coherent model of how they chain together, and the full ladder has historically only been affordable at team/org scale — a solo or small team couldn't sustain most of these tiers without AI doing a chunk of the labor. Worth spelling out explicitly, since this is one of the areas AI tooling changes from "aspirational" to "actually achievable" at small scale.

**The ladder, in order of increasing exposure:**

1. **Unit tests** — smallest possible scope, one function/module in isolation. This is where TDD (Part 1) lives — written *before* the implementation, driving the AI's generation rather than checking it after the fact.
2. **Integration tests** — verify units work together correctly (does the API call actually reach the database layer correctly, does the UI component receive the right shape of data). Sits inside Continuous Integration as a CI gate.
3. **Regression tests** — an accumulating suite that locks in every bug fix so it can't silently return. AI tooling is unusually good here: every time a bug is found and fixed, generating the regression test that would have caught it is close to free, whereas historically this was the tier most teams let atrophy because writing regression tests after the fact felt like unrewarding overhead.
4. **Internal / "dogfooding"** — using your own build before anyone else does. For a solo/small team, this is effectively you as the first internal user — but Feature Flags (Part 3) let you extend this tier further than one person alone could: ship behind a flag, use it yourself in production-real conditions for a while, before deciding to widen exposure.
5. **Alpha** — a small, trusted external group, still expecting rough edges, fast feedback loop. This is where Domain Gap Surfacing's straw-polling arguably belongs on the code/product side, not just the spec side — the same instinct (get outside eyes on your weak points) applies to a working build, not only a document.
6. **Beta** — wider exposure, feature-complete but not fully hardened, still pre-GA. Feature Flags + Progressive Delivery is the natural mechanism here — widen the flag's audience percentage rather than doing a hard cutover.
7. **Release / General Availability** — full exposure. Observability (Part 3) takes over as the primary detection mechanism from here on, since pre-release testing tiers can no longer catch everything by definition.
8. **Patch / hotfix cycle** — the fast-turnaround loop for issues found in production. Tied directly to Error Budgets (how much post-release breakage is tolerable before the process itself needs review) and Blameless Postmortems (what layer of the earlier tiers should have caught this, and didn't).

*Illustrative example only, not a prescription — cadence has to fit your own risk tolerance and user base:* a severity-tiered response, e.g. security/data-loss issues patched within hours regardless of the normal release rhythm; functional regressions affecting real usage patched within a day or two; cosmetic/minor issues simply roll into the next regular release rather than triggering an out-of-band patch. The point isn't the specific thresholds — it's that having *any* explicit tiering, decided in advance, is what keeps a hotfix decision fast and non-agonized-over when something breaks, rather than re-litigating "how urgent is this, really" under pressure each time.

**Why AI tooling specifically changes the economics of this ladder:**

- **Regression suites stop atrophying.** The traditional failure mode — regression tests never get written because it's tedious, unrewarded work done after the interesting part is over — is exactly the kind of task AI handles well and cheaply. This tier alone is probably the single biggest quality lever most under-resourced teams (solo or small) leave unused.
- **Internal/alpha tiers become viable without hiring.** These tiers traditionally required either enough internal headcount to dogfood meaningfully or a QA/beta-coordination function most small teams can't staff. AI-driven exploratory testing (an agent probing edge cases, generating unusual inputs, simulating varied user paths) can approximate some of what a QA team's alpha-tier value used to require.
- **The ladder's cost curve flattens.** Historically, each additional tier cost roughly linear additional effort, which is why small teams collapse tiers together (skip straight from "I tested it" to "it's live"). AI reduces the marginal cost of maintaining several of these tiers simultaneously, which is arguably what makes the full aiXP practice set (spec-first, TDD-as-load-bearing, executive review, risk-tiered merge, feature-flagged rollout, observability) coherent as a *system* rather than an unaffordable wishlist.

**Where this connects back to existing aiXP practices:** Perception-Gated Work is the category most likely to slip through tiers 1–3 untested (it's not unit-testable by nature) — which is precisely why tiers 4–6 (internal → alpha → beta, gated by Feature Flags) matter more for aiXP than they did in classic XP's small-releases model, and why Observability has to close the loop for whatever slips past all of them.
