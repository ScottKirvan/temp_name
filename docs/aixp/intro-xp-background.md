# XP's Original Bet

Extreme Programming, as Kent Beck described it in the late 1990s, was built on a single core insight: **tight feedback loops beat upfront certainty.** Instead of writing a long requirements document and building to it for six months, you write the smallest useful test, build the smallest thing that passes it, integrate it immediately, and repeat. The uncertainty is still there — it just surfaces in days rather than months, when it's cheap to respond to rather than expensive to recover from.

That insight drove the twelve original practices: test-driven development, pair programming, continuous integration, small releases, on-site customer, and the rest. They're not arbitrary — each one is a mechanism for shortening a particular feedback loop that traditional software processes had made too long.

## What XP got right

The core bet has held up. Fast feedback cycles do beat upfront certainty for most software problems, and the practices that enforce fast cycles — TDD especially — have become mainstream even among engineers who would never call themselves XP practitioners. The Agile movement, for all its later distortions, spread XP's basic timing instinct broadly through the industry.

XP also correctly diagnosed that software quality and development speed are not in tension when the feedback loops are tight enough. A comprehensive test suite doesn't slow you down; it's what lets you refactor without fear, which is what keeps pace sustainable over time.

## Where XP's assumptions were wrong

XP was designed for a specific context: a small team, a real customer physically available to answer questions, stable requirements within an iteration. Those assumptions were always aspirational, even in 2000. The "on-site customer" in particular was the weakest link — Beck himself acknowledged that most teams didn't have one. The practice often degraded into a proxy relationship with a product manager who was too busy to actually sit with the team, which quietly broke the feedback loop that on-site customer was supposed to close.

More fundamentally, XP assumed that *writing code* was the primary bottleneck. The practices are optimized for human developers working at human speed, where the cost of a test is writing it, the cost of a refactor is the time to do it, and the cost of over-specifying is the work it produces.

Those cost assumptions no longer hold.

## Why XP specifically

There are other Agile methodologies — Scrum, Kanban, SAFe, and more. The reason this book builds from XP rather than from those is that XP is a *technical* discipline, not a process framework. Scrum tells you how to run meetings and structure sprints. XP tells you how to write code. The practices are engineering practices first, and they operate at the level of a single developer's workday — which is exactly where AI tools operate.

When AI joins the team, the question is not "how do we adjust our sprint ceremonies" — it's "how do we write code, verify it, and integrate it in a way that accounts for what's different about how it's being generated." XP is the right lineage for that question.
