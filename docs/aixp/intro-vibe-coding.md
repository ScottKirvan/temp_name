# The Problem with Vibe Coding

"Vibe coding" is a term that emerged in early 2025 to describe a particular mode of working with AI coding tools: describe what you want in natural language, accept what the model generates, iterate by feel until it seems to work, ship it. The appeal is obvious. The problem is equally obvious once you've done it long enough.

Vibe coding is not software engineering. This isn't a values judgment — it's a description of what's missing. Software engineering, at minimum, means: knowing what the code is supposed to do, having a way to verify that it does it, and understanding what breaks if it changes. Vibe coding, in its pure form, provides none of these. It provides output that often *looks* correct and *feels* like progress, because the model is very good at producing plausible-looking code. But plausible and correct are different things, and the gap between them is where the debt accumulates.

## The failure modes are predictable

They're not random bugs. They're structural:

**Correctness drift.** Generated code passes the immediate test you ran in your head, but fails cases you didn't think of. Without a formal test suite, there's no fast way to know which cases those are until they appear in production.

**Scope creep.** AI tools, when underspecified, don't stay in their lane — they produce the code that *seems* to follow from the prompt, which often includes things you didn't ask for. Without a spec to diff against, there's no way to catch this systematically.

**Context collapse.** Each session starts fresh. The model has no memory of yesterday's architectural decisions, last week's refactor rationale, or the bug you fixed two months ago that this new code just reintroduced. Without maintained context artifacts, this compounds indefinitely.

**Vigilance fatigue.** Reviewing generated code looks like a lighter cognitive load than writing it. It isn't — it's a different cognitive load, and one that degrades faster. Accepting the 40th diff of the day with the same attention as the first is not possible for most people, and the failure mode is invisible: you don't feel yourself rubber-stamping, you just do it.

## Why this matters now

These failure modes existed before AI tools; what changed is the rate at which they compound. A single engineer writing code by hand produces roughly as much change per day as their judgment can keep up with. An engineer pairing with an AI tool can produce an order of magnitude more change per day — but their capacity for judgment didn't scale with it. The debt accumulates faster than the feedback loops that would catch it, and the result isn't a pile of obvious bugs; it's a codebase that *works* right now but resists change, can't be safely refactored, and fails in ways that are hard to trace.

The answer isn't to use AI tools less. It's to use them with the same discipline that good engineering has always required — adapted for what's actually different now.
