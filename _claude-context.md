# Claude Context — aiXP Writing Project

## What this vault is

A writing project, not a codebase. The deliverable is a paper, talk, post, or book (format undecided) on **aiXP** — a proposed software engineering discipline for AI-assisted development, grounded in the author's months of daily practice pairing with Claude Code on real projects.

## Vault structure

- `docs/` — VitePress project root; dev server via `npm run docs:dev`
- `docs/aixp/` — primary working source material (`01` through `06` are the methodology itself)
- `docs/.vitepress/config.mts` — nav/sidebar config; update when adding pages under `docs/aixp/`
- `docs/index.md` — site landing page
- `notes/` — scratch/draft material (e.g. `aiXP-draft.md`)
- `app.json` — project config (purpose TBD)

New content pages go under `docs/aixp/`. Don't add top-level markdown without updating the sidebar.

## Voice and editorial guardrails

- Direct, technically precise — no hype language ("revolutionary," "unlock," etc.)
- Vibe coding is not software engineering: treat this as settled, do not soften it
- Distinguish always between: (a) tested in production, (b) adapted by analogy, (c) speculative
- No invented examples, case studies, or fabricated citations
- Every borrowed concept (Lean, SRE, Kanban, XP) gets attributed to its origin
- Open questions live in `docs/aixp/open-questions.md` — surface them, don't resolve unilaterally

## Standing positions (settled — don't re-litigate)

- TDD is load-bearing in aiXP, not merely one practice among many
- Agent Role Topology stays flat by design
- Executive code review is context-free by design ("make the code speak")
- aiXP is a practitioner-scale discipline within the broader AI-native movement
